  Timer
  Visualisation::
    progress of players in a game, stats etc d3 js
  Profiling code for measuring performance and optimisation::
    Concurrency using threads vs process vs events
    Functional style programming etc
    compression, size/bandwidth related.
    sinatra vs rails vs node.js
    static vs dynamic code analysis.
  Performance Testing::
    apache bench vs locust vs jmeter
    blitz.io
